# RemoteKeycard
 A plugin that allows players to open LockerChambers and doors that require a Keycard without having to have the Keycard in hand.

# Installation
You can install this plugin using the command ``p install SrLicht/RemoteKeycard`` or by downloading the .dll file and placing it in ``SCP Secret Laboratory/PluginAPI/plugins/global or your port``.

# Pi pi pi

If for some reason the plugin doesn't work I try to enable ``traditional_methods`` config, if this still doesn't work enable ``is_debug = true`` take a screenshot to the console and create an Issue on Github
